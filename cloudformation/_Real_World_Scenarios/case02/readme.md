## Integration of AWS CloudFormation with GitHub Actions

To automate the deployment of your AWS CloudFormation stacks using GitHub Actions, follow these steps to set up your repository. This integration allows you to deploy your infrastructure directly from your GitHub repository whenever changes are made.

### Directory Structure

Your repository should have the following structure:

```
your-repo/
│
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── main.yaml
│
└── template.yaml
```

### 1. **Create the GitHub Actions Workflow Directory**

1. **Directory Creation:**
   - Create a directory named `.github` at the root of your repository if it doesn’t already exist.
   - Inside `.github`, create a subdirectory named `workflows`.

   ```
   mkdir -p .github/workflows
   ```

2. **Create the Workflow File:**
   - In the `.github/workflows` directory, create a file named `main.yaml`. This file will define your GitHub Actions workflow.

### 2. **Configure GitHub Actions Workflow**

The `main.yaml` file will contain the configuration for GitHub Actions to handle the deployment process. Here’s an example of what this file might look like:


### 3. **Prepare the CloudFormation Template**

1. **Create the Template File:**
   - At the root of your repository (next to the `.github` directory), create a file named `template.yaml`. This file will contain your CloudFormation template.

2. **Example CloudFormation Template:**
   - Here’s a basic example of what the `template.yaml` might include:

 
### 4. **Set Up AWS Credentials**

1. **Configure Secrets:**
   - Go to your GitHub repository settings.
   - Under the "Secrets and variables" section, add your AWS credentials as secrets:
     - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
     - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

### 5. **Testing and Deployment**

- **Commit Changes:**
  - Commit and push your changes to the `main` branch of your repository. This will trigger the GitHub Actions workflow defined in `main.yaml`.

- **Monitor Workflow:**
  - Go to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository to monitor the status of your workflow and check for any issues during deployment.
